# Small_Wheater_Project
## This program makes it possible to consume a weather API, which allows you to collect data from a city and do some treatments, and in addition, you can also get graphs.

#### Here you will find, a guide with all the procedures to make this little climate program. 

Below are the procedures, which are arranged in 3 stages.

***1. Stage) register an account on the RapidAPI website***

   1. You need to register an account on the RapidAPI website to get an API key

***2. Stage) Build The program*** 

Below, you can see all the functionalities in my program and its corresponding functions, with all the packages that you need to install 

   * Function to grap informations that the API gives (Weather_City) \
```pip install requests``` \
```pip install pprintpp```
   * Function to convert Timestamp to human date (Epoch_to_Datetime) \
```pip install DateTime```   
   * Function to place the data of a chosen weather feature in a list or dictionary (Hourly_features)
   * Function to get the average of a chosen weather feature (Average)
   * Function to get the maximum value of a chosen weather feature (Max)
   * Function to get the minimum value of a chosen weather feature (Min)
   * Function to get graphic of a chosen weather feature (Graphics) \
```pip install matplotlib```

***3. Stage) Inputs to use the program*** 
   * Choose a city
   * Get the latidude of the chosen city
   * Get the longitude of the chosen city
   * Get the Dt (timestamp) of the chosen city
